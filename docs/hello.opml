			<outline text="I am Dave Winer, editor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com&quot;&gt;Scripting News&lt;/a&gt;, and the developer of FeedLand. " created="Fri, 21 Oct 2022 14:59:37 GMT"/>
			<outline text="Thanks for coming to visit. Right now the product is still in testing, with about 20 people, since August 2022. " created="Fri, 21 Oct 2022 14:59:51 GMT"/>
			<outline text="It's a community product, we all collaborate on feed lists, and creating news products. " created="Fri, 21 Oct 2022 15:00:09 GMT"/>
			<outline text="At this writing, in October 2022, I'm not sure what the next step is. I want to keep the group I work with personally small, but I also want lots of people to use FeedLand. But I don't want to rush into a decision here, I've done that in the past, and it would have done better to go slower, so I'm learning, I hope." created="Fri, 21 Oct 2022 15:00:33 GMT"/>
			<outline text="Anyway, if we know each other, and you really want to get into the test group, okay -- let's do it. Send me an email at dave.winer@gmail.com, and I'll see what I can do. " created="Fri, 21 Oct 2022 15:01:46 GMT"/>
			<outline text="In the meantime, you're welcome to read the docs, they are listed in the left margin." created="Fri, 21 Oct 2022 15:02:34 GMT"/>
