			<outline text="Categories allow you to customize the news in FeedLand, assigning each feed you're subscribed to to one or more categories. You decide on the categories, and whether or not to display them on the News page of FeedLand. You can also use the categories in your &lt;a href=&quot;newsProducts.opml&quot;&gt;news products&lt;/a&gt;." created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:41:05 GMT"/>

		<outline text="Deciding on your categories" created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:43:32 GMT">
			<outline text="First think about what categories you want to use initially. I recommend just using two or three, to get used to the concepts. You can change your mind later. Here's a suggestion of a list of categories to start with." created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:43:36 GMT">
				<outline text="All, Tech, Politics, NYT, Bloggers" created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:44:33 GMT"/>
				</outline>
			<outline text="You would then assign feeds that are largely about tech to the Tech category. " created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:45:42 GMT"/>
			<outline text="If you were following a tech blogger, you would assign them to both Tech and Bloggers. " created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:46:33 GMT"/>
			<outline text="I recommend having an &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; category, and unless you feel strongly that a feed should not be in it, that all feeds are. There are situations when you would not assign a feed to the All category. " created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:46:54 GMT"/>
			<outline text="When you've settled on a list of categories, open the Settings dialog, click on the Categories tab, and enter the category names, separated by commas, in the first box. You should leave the second box empty. It allows you to choose the categories that are displayed in tabs on the News page. You can come back to that later if you have too many categories to fit on the home page." created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:48:09 GMT"/>

		<outline text="Assigning feeds to categories" created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:51:15 GMT">
			<outline text="Open the Feed List page. You'll notice a new icon next to the title of a feed. It looks like a tag. If the tag is dark that means the feed has categories already set, if it's light, only &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; is checked. " created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:51:23 GMT">

			<outline text="When you click it a list of checkboxes for each of your categories appears. Only the &lt;i&gt;All&lt;/i&gt; checkbox is checked. " created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 13:23:42 GMT"/>
			<outline text="Click the categories that apply to this feed. The checkboxes are hot, they change in the database immediately when you click on them. " created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:53:57 GMT"/>
			<outline text="The title of the feed appears at the top of the dialog. If you hover the mouse over the title you'll see a tooltip with the description of the feed, as provided in the feed itself. Not all feeds have descriptions, and some of them aren't informative, but for now the title and description are all we have to go by here. " created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:54:42 GMT"/>
			<outline text="The arrows at the bottom of the dialog allow you to move between feeds in the Feed List without having to close and re-open the dialog. I made it work this way because all the clicking quickly became tedious. With this approach categorization is smooth and gratifying, and even at times fun." created="Thu, 08 Sep 2022 12:55:49 GMT"/>

			<outline text="Open the Settings dialog, click on the Categories tab, and enter in the second box, the category names, separated by commas, of the categories you want to include on your News page.

			<outline text="If you have no categories defined, ie you're a new user, if you open the Categories dialog for any feed you will have one choice, All. It will not be checked. It's just a suggestion." created="Sat, 10 Sep 2022 16:22:13 GMT"/>
