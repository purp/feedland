Sometimes you need to write a utility for database management that can't be done at the command line. This is a shell for such utilities.

#### How to

Look for the comment that says: <i>Call your utilities here.</i> You can put code there that uses the database.xxx routines to do the same kind of stuff that the FeedLand client does.

You must add your own config.json file that includes a database section, as shown in the example file in this folder.

At some point we will be doing these things in Drummer's scripting language, but not there yet.
