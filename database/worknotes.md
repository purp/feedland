Fixed all kinds of problems in setUserPrefs. See comment at the head of the routine. 

#### 5/7/23 by DW

Major change to setUserPrefs.

Previously we would assign to all columns in a users table record, even if the caller only provided a few values.

This comes up in marktwain because it doesn't do anything with tabs and categories, for example, or news products.

If an element of an object has the value undefined, when we encode the values, it is changed to NULL and that overwrites whatever was in that column.

Now we add to the userRec more carefully, only adding values that are provided in the object provided by the caller.

New routine -- getRiverFromScreenname.

See this thread for the reason this was needed.

Started private <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandDatabase">feedlandDatabase</a> repo on GitHub.

Lots of work done since 8/19, no notes. Sorry. ;-)

#### 8/19/22 by DW

Subscribing is too slow. Trying an experiment, to return before all the items are checked. Let that happen in an independent thread.

#### 7/23/22 by DW

New function: getRecentSubscriptions for the log page.

#### 7/20/22 by DW

Add new column to feeds whoFirstSubscribed.

config.maxNewFeedSubscriptions says how many new subscriptions a user can do. no limit to the number of subscriptions overall.

#### 7/12/22 by DW

Lots of changes with no notes, sorry.

#### 7/3/22 by DW -- 0.4.15

Left out the <i>readWholeFile</i> config callback linking to daveappserver, added. 

We're no longer maintaining feeds.opml. via config.flMaintainFeedsOpml. You should not turn it on, it won't work. It was there so that when you subscribed to a single feed, it would automatically be added to the user's feeds.opml file. But that was before we switched to using the simpler feed editor. It's still possible to use an outliner to edit your feed list, but it is no longer integrated with the database system. 

#### 7/2/22 by DW -- 0.4.11

When looking for the next feed to check, only consider feeds with 1 or more subscribers.

The new version of the reallySimple package tells us how many seconds it took to read the feed, so we no longer have to figure that out for ourselves. 

#### 7/1/22 by DW -- 0.4.7

When recording an error we were't setting whenLastError in the feedrec.

Fixed a bug that broke the ctSecs value in a feedrec.

Fixed a bug in ctConsecutiveErrors in a feedrec. It wasn't being reset to 0 when there was no error.

Log when we check a feed. I need to be able to see this.

ctSecs in the feedRec wasn't being set if the feed didn't change. 

#### 6/30/22 by DW

Change to processSubscriptionList.

New optional param, flDeleteEnabled. Defaults true, which is the original behavior. It syncs the OPML text provided with your subscriptions. Any feeds that are present are subscribed to, any that are not are unsubbed. 

Set it false if you want to import an OPML list, not sync.

#### 6/27/22 by DW

Pulled out of main project to be a standalone package, so you can build apps that access the database with a different or no user interface.

Calls to other modules, daveappserver and viewers, transitioned to callbacks in the options object passed to database.start.
