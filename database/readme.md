# FeedLand database

A database for storing feeds for FeedLand aggregators.

#### Background

I'm posting this as a private repository so a few of the testers can study the database, and perhaps make recommendations.

This is not licensed, yet at least. But the repository is published to NPM so you can write test code if you create your own database and set it up via config to work with it.
